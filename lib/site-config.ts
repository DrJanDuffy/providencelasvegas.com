// Expert quotes from Dr. Jan Duffy
export const expertQuotes = {
  market: `"The Las Vegas market remains strong heading into 2026. We're seeing continued demand from California relocators and remote workers, but the days of 20 offers on every listing are behind us. Buyers finally have some negotiating power."`,
  buyers: `"My job isn't just to show you houses—it's to make sure you don't overpay, that you understand what you're buying, and that you're protected through every step of the transaction."`,
  sellers: `"Pricing your home correctly from day one is the single most important factor in getting top dollar. Overpriced homes sit, and every day on market costs you money."`,
  luxury: `"Luxury buyers expect discretion, market expertise, and flawless execution. In this price range, one wrong move can cost hundreds of thousands of dollars."`,
  investment: `"Las Vegas rental yields are among the best in the country right now. But you need to know which neighborhoods are appreciating and which have peaked."`,
  relocation: `"Moving to a new city is stressful enough. I handle everything from neighborhood tours to school research to contractor referrals so you can focus on your new beginning."`,
  newConstruction: `"Builders have sales agents who work for them, not you. Having your own representation costs you nothing but can save you tens of thousands in upgrades and negotiations."`,
  valueProposition: `"When clients ask why they should choose a Berkshire Hathaway HomeServices agent, I tell them: you're not just getting me—you're getting a global network of 50,000 agents, world-class marketing, and a brand that's synonymous with trust."`,
